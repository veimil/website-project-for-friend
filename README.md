# My Project

This is my personal website project displaying ring designs of my friend. 

The main focus of this project was to use HTML and CSS together with some front-end JavaScript with good programming practices, and to make the website using mobile-first approach using CSS media queries and 12-column CSS-grid. During the project I also used GIMP to edit the images into convenient format.
